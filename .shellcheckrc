# ShellCheck configuration for dotfiles
# Documentation: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki

# Disable specific checks that conflict with our patterns
disable=SC1090  # Can't follow non-constant source (we use dynamic sourcing)
disable=SC1091  # Not following source files (external completions)
disable=SC2034  # Unused variables (many are exported for child processes)
disable=SC2154  # Referenced but not assigned (exported vars from other modules)
disable=SC2086  # Double quote to prevent globbing (low-risk in our usage)
disable=SC2295  # Expansions in ${..} patterns (intentional pattern matching)

# Enable optional checks
enable=quote-safe-variables
# Note: require-variable-braces disabled as it's too strict for existing codebase
# enable=require-variable-braces

# Set shell dialect
shell=bash

# Source files are in multiple directories
source-path=SCRIPTDIR
